# PortMaster Wine - Overload
This isn't really a port, it's Overload running on wine64 and box64. It will boot and play on the Retroid Pocket 5 and Retroid Pocket Mini with a Rocknix distribution that has box64 and wine64 bundled. Such distributions (dev builds) can be found on the Rocknix Discord server.

## Installation
Copy the `overload` folder and `Overload.sh` file to the same place you would normally place your port files e.g. `/roms/ports`. Purchase and install the game with Steam or GOG on Windows and copy all of its data to `overload/data`.

If you want to set up the emulationstation decorations, copy `cover.png` to the `overload` folder and copy the contents of `gameinfo.xml` to your `gamelist.xml` file.
